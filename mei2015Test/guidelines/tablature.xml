    <!-- Overview -->
    <head>Overview of the Tablature Module</head>
    <p>The tablature module is used to record basic tablature notation. It is designed primarily for
      guitar and similar plucked-string instruments.</p>

    <p>The <att>lines</att> attribute on the <gi scheme="MEI">staffDef</gi> element is used to
      record the number of the instrument's strings or courses. The <att>tab.strings</att> attribute
      is then used to enumerate the pitches of the open strings. It is important to note that this
      is given using the written pitch, not the sounding pitch. For example, the Western 6-string
      guitar, in standard tuning, sounds an octave below written pitch.</p>

    <p>The <att>tab.strings</att> attribute gives the string tuning, ordered from highest to lowest
      pitch.</p>

    <p>For standard guitar tuning, the <gi scheme="MEI">staffDef</gi> element might look like
      this:</p>
    <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" xml:space="preserve">
<staffDef n="1" lines="6" tab.strings="e5 b4 g4 d4 a3 e3"/>
    </egXML>

    <p>Chromatic alteration of the open string's pitch may be indicated with '-' or 'f' (for flat),
      or '#' or 's' (for sharp). Multiple sharps and flats are not permitted.</p>

    <p>A guitar in E-flat tuning might look like this:</p>
    <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" xml:space="preserve">
<staffDef n="1" lines="6" tab.strings="ef5 bf4 gf4 df4 af3 ef3"/>
    </egXML>

    <p>On some instruments, such as the 12-string guitar, the strings are arranged in
        <soCalled>courses</soCalled>, groups of two or more adjacent strings that are closely spaced
      relative to the other strings, often tuned in unison or octaves. Because a course is typically
      played as though it were a single string, a tablature staff for these instruments contains one
      line <emph>for each course</emph>. For instruments such as this, the pitches for each course
      are recorded as a single token. For example, the open strings of the 12-string guitar may be
      indicated using:</p>
    <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" xml:space="preserve">
<staffDef n="1" lines="6" tab.strings="e3e4 a3a4 d3d4 g4g5 b4b4 e5e5"/>
    </egXML>

    <p>The <gi scheme="MEI">note</gi> element is used to capture the specific events in the
      tablature. A numeric value in the <att>tab.string</att> attribute is used to capture the
      string on which the note is to be played, counting in the same order (lowest to highest) as
      that given in <att>tab.strings</att>. This attribute takes a positive integer in the range of
      1-9.</p>
    <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" xml:space="preserve">
<note tab.string="3" pname="a" oct="3" dur="4"/>
    </egXML>

    <p>In the case of fretted instruments, the fret number may be captured using the
        <att>tab.fret</att> attribute, while an open string may be indicated using the letter
      "o".</p>
    <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" xml:space="preserve" valid="false">
<note tab.string="6" pname="a" oct="2" dur="4" tab.fret="5"/>
<note tab.string="5" pname="a" oct="2" dur="4" tab.fret="o"/>
    </egXML>
